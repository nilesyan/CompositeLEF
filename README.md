# CompositeLEF Simulation

A composite LEF consists of a remodeler and an SMC. The remodeler kicks off nucleosomes and creates nucleosome-depleted regions so that the SMC can follow. The program simulates trajectories of the remodeler, the SMC, and the junctions between the nearest nucleosome and the LEF components.
